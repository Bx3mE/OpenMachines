# OpenMachines

We created this project in hopes that it becomes a seed for the collection and curation of good known open source solutions for DIY and Industrial Mods for Open Source Machines and Processes

The objective of this github organization is to challenge the industry status quo and establish crowdsourced standards based on the idea of [Citizen Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen_science)

We believe in free proven knowlage with proper source and respective [kudos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kudos), design exploration by iteration, [serendipity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serendipity), reuse promotion and propagation of great design ideas.
